Define the terms: method, class, function, field, variable
Define the terms in relation to each other. ie a method is a function, defined within an object…a function is…
Commit changes to this file as you add more definitions and explanations

1. METHOD-
    A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

    Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

    A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method,
    followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(),
    but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

    Method is a function within a function/object.


2.CLASS-
    Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
    For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color,
    and methods, such as drive and brake.

    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


3.FUNCTION-
    Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

    Function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).



4.FIELD-
    A Java field is a variable inside a class. For instance, in a class representing an employee,
    the Employee class might contain the following fields:

    name
    position
    salary
    hiredDate

    The Java field access modifier determines whether the field can be accessed by classes other than the class owning the field.
    There are four possible access modifiers for Java fields:

    private
    package
    protected
    public


5.VARIABLE-
    It is actually an attribute of the class.
    Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:


6.STATIC/PUBLIC-
    You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.

    STATIC method,
    which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of
    the class,
    Unlike PUBLIC, which can only be accessed by objects:


7.PRIMITIVE/REFERENCE DATA TYPE-

    PRIMITIVE- has 8 types- (byte_short_int_long_float_double_char_boolean)

    when using primitive types you Do NOT need to allocate memory. primitive types is used to store
    simple values.
    these single values are complete different of each other in memory stored.
                        ///////////////////////
    REFERENCE- When dealing with reference types we should always allocate memory,
    example- whatever= new()  -method.

    Reference is a blueprint for creating new objects/instances, an object is an instance of the class.
    Strings are reference type.

    stores complex object data.
    STORES a reference to an OBJECT somewhere in the memory.
