Define the terms: method, class, function, field, variable
Define the terms in relation to each other. ie a method is a function, defined within an object…a function is…

1. METHOD-
    A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

    Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

    A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method,
    followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(),
    but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:

    Method is a function within a function/object.


2.CLASS-
    Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
    For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color,
    and methods, such as drive and brake.

    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.



    3.FUNCTION





    4.FIELD




    5.VARIABLE-
    It is actually an attribute of the class.
    Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:


    6.STATIC/PUBLIC-
    You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.

    STATIC method,
    which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of
    the class,
    Unlike PUBLIC, which can only be accessed by objects:
